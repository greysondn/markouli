*Italics*

**bold**

***bold italics***

**bold *bold italics* bold** *italics* - and also _italics_.

~~is this really struck text? I think that's an extension...~~

*italics with: **bold**, ~~strikeout~~*

**bold with: *italics*, ~~strikeout~~**

~~strikeout with: **bold**, *italics*~~

Well, at least people can't make me cry with weird combinations alone.

But what happens if we interleave them?

*italics and then **switch to bold and* undo italics before** undoing bold? ... according to CuteMarkEd anyway, it was never bold.
