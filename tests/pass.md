Plaintext for days.

Line  
break.

*Italics*

**bold**

***bold italics***

**bold *bold italics* bold** *italics* - and also _italics_.

~~is this really struck text? I think that's an extension...~~

*italics with: **bold**, ~~strikeout~~*

**bold with: *italics*, ~~strikeout~~**

~~strikeout with: **bold**, *italics*~~

Well, at least people can't make me cry with weird combinations alone.

But what happens if we interleave them?

*italics and then **switch to bold and* undo italics before** undoing bold? ... according to CuteMarkEd anyway, it was never bold.

Does __underline__ exist? Pandoc says no, sorry kids.

Links exist! Three types...

Internal entries: [display](entryid).

Internal entries with anchors: [display](entryid#anchor).

Web links: [display](https://github.com/greysondn/markouli).

Images come later, naturally.

I also need keyboard keys, if only so I can make jokes about trying to  <kbd>togglePerspective</kbd>  in a text document.
